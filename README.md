audio
=====

A C++11 library for real-time audio playback based on OpenAL.

Planned Features
----------------
* Streaming of multiple sound sources (on a separate thread, if desired)
* User-defined sound groups (e.g. music, in-game effects, HUD, speech) which can be manipulated as a whole
* EAX effect support
* Optional high-level primitives, i.e. Sound Objects with a persistent position that automatically release channels when they are out of range
